# hello-world
My first repository

Hi my name is Andy Lam. Yesterday, I graduated from The University of Britich Columbia with a B.Sc. Major in Biochemistry. It seems nowadays just simply having a degree isn't going to get you anywhere regardless of your field. Thus I tried out an introductory programming course at UBC, CPSC 301: Computing for life sciences, where I got introducted to programming through Python 3. I found that I really enjoyed coding with Python (shamlessly bragging, I got 94% in that course the average was 83% though). Now I'm starting out with html and css and I wanted to keep a personal website to see how my skills are growing. I hope having programming skills would make me more desirable, as I cannot find a job in biotech/biomed nor have I entered a grad program yet.

Thanks for taking the time to read my little introduction. You may be finding it cute, I hope that it's interesting to you.

Sincerely,

Andy Lam
